{- $dslTutorial

 This module provides a way of constructing bot commands in a declarative way.

 The main component of this is the 'Calamity.Commands.Dsl.command' function,
 which takes a type-level list of command parameters, the name, and the callback
 and produces a command. There are also the alternatives
 'Calamity.Commands.Dsl.command'', 'commandA' and 'commandA'', for when you want
 to handle parsing of the input yourself, and/or want aliases of the command.

 The functions: 'hide', 'help', 'requires', and 'group' can be used to change
 attributes of any commands declared inside the monadic action passed to them,
 for example:

 @
 'hide' '$' do
   'Calamity.Commands.Dsl.command' \@'[] "test" \\ctx -> 'pure' ()
 @

 In the above block, any command declared inside 'hide' will have its
 \'hidden\' flag set and will not be shown by the default help command:
 'Calamity.Commands.Help.helpCommand'

 The 'Calamity.Commands.Help.helpCommand' function can be used to create a
 help command for the commands DSL action it is used in, read its doc page
 for more information on how it functions.

 The 'Calamity.Commands.Utils.addCommands' function creates the command
 handler for the commands registered in the passed action, it is what reads a
 message to determine what command was invoked. It should be used to register the
 commands with the bot by using it inside the setup action, for example:

 @
 'Calamity.Client.runBotIO' ('Calamity.BotToken' token)
   $ 'Calamity.Commands.Utils.addCommands' $ do
     'Calamity.Commands.Help.helpCommand'
     'Calamity.Commands.Dsl.command' \@'[] "test" \\ctx ->
       'Control.Monad.void' $ 'Calamity.Types.Tellable.tell' \@'L.Text' ctx "hi"
 @

 The above block will create a command with no parameters named \'test\',
 along with a help command.

 Command parameters are parsed by first invoking
 'CalamityCommands.Parser.parse' for the first
 'CalamityCommands.Parser.ParameterParser', then running the next parser on the
 remaining input, and so on.
